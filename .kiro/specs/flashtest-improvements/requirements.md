# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification outlines comprehensive improvements to the FlashTest application to enhance its architecture, user experience, performance, and maintainability. The improvements focus on migrating from file-based storage to a proper database, improving code quality, adding better error handling, and enhancing the overall user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the file-based question storage with a proper database solution, so that the application is more scalable, reliable, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a SQLite database for question storage
2. WHEN a new question is added THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with proper validation
3. WHEN questions are retrieved THEN the system SHALL fetch them from the database with proper error handling
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback behavior
5. IF a database operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 2: Improved State Management and Code Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor the complex state management in the main component, so that the code is more maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz state needs to be managed THEN the system SHALL use a custom hook for quiz session management
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use smaller, focused components for better maintainability
3. WHEN state updates occur THEN the system SHALL handle them through proper state management patterns
4. IF state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide error boundaries to prevent crashes

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific field-level error messages
4. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging while showing generic user messages
5. IF the application crashes THEN the system SHALL show an error boundary with recovery options

### Requirement 4: Performance and Loading State Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators and smooth interactions, so that I understand when the application is processing my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN forms are being submitted THEN the system SHALL show submission states and disable duplicate submissions
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback through optimistic updates where appropriate
4. WHEN long operations are running THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all critical functionality, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL have unit tests covering all quiz state transitions
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL have integration tests for all endpoints
3. WHEN components are built THEN the system SHALL have component tests for user interactions
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL have end-to-end tests for critical user flows
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 6: Code Quality and Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and quality checks, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent formatting through Prettier
2. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run ESLint checks and prevent commits with errors
3. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL have strict type checking enabled
4. WHEN pre-commit hooks run THEN the system SHALL validate code quality and run tests
5. IF code quality standards are not met THEN the system SHALL prevent the commit

### Requirement 7: Enhanced User Experience Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved navigation and accessibility features, so that I can use the application efficiently and it's accessible to all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the quiz THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts for navigation
2. WHEN questions are displayed THEN the system SHALL be accessible to screen readers
3. WHEN colors are used THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG contrast guidelines
4. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management
5. IF accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL support them without degrading the experience for other users

### Requirement 8: Performance Analytics and Learning Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my learning progress and receive insights about my performance, so that I can improve my study effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete quiz sessions THEN the system SHALL store my performance data
2. WHEN I view my progress THEN the system SHALL display learning analytics and trends
3. WHEN questions are repeated THEN the system SHALL use spaced repetition algorithms to optimize learning
4. WHEN I struggle with topics THEN the system SHALL identify weak areas and suggest focused practice
5. IF I want to review past performance THEN the system SHALL provide historical data and insights

### Requirement 9: Security and Input Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be secure against common vulnerabilities, so that user data is protected and the system is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit data THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive internal information
5. IF malicious input is detected THEN the system SHALL reject it and log the attempt

### Requirement 10: Deployment and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined deployment and configuration management, so that the application can be easily deployed and maintained across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations
2. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL handle them automatically
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables
4. WHEN health checks are performed THEN the system SHALL report the status of all critical services
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
